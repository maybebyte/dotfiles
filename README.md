These are tuned to my own preferences, but maybe you'll find something
useful in here. I'd like to document this more thoroughly in the future.

For now, here's a quick overview of my neovim and shell setups.

## Neovim

My neovim config comes with support for many things that make life
easier for me. I use lazy.nvim as a plugin manager. Here's some
functionality provided by plugins:

- mason.nvim, for installing tools (formatters, LSPs, linters, etc).
- LSP support (completions, integrated lookup, go to definition/references, etc).
- Code snippets.
- Treesitter.
- Telescope.
- Indentation markers.
- Integrated formatting and linting.
- Integrated debugging tools.
- Git and GnuPG integration.

## Shell

- Vim bindings.
- FZF integration.
- Syntax highlighting.
- Autosuggestions.
- Zoxide as cd.
- Delta as a git pager.
- Bat as cat/less.
- Eza as ls.
- Various convenience functions and aliases.
